# Test Results and Communication Log

## Testing Protocol
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- NEVER invoke frontend testing without explicit user permission
- READ and UPDATE this file each time before invoking testing agents
- Take MINIMUM number of steps when editing this file
- ALWAYS follow guidelines mentioned here
