The AI engineer successfully bootstrapped the Meme Trader V4 Pro project, a Telegram-based crypto trading bot, from a skeleton codebase. The initial phase focused on establishing core infrastructure: SQLite database, Telegram bot integration, basic monitoring, analysis, and 0x API client, including Emergent LLM. Debugging efforts resolved Web3 import issues and confirmed bot startup.

Following a detailed user request for Step 2, which involved advanced trading logic (mempool, honeypot, mirror trading), multi-wallet support, and enhanced security/documentation, the AI began implementation. This involved creating dedicated integration modules () and a core wallet manager (), while also updating , , , and . User-provided API keys were crucial for configuring live testnet connections, and a secure execution wallet was successfully generated. The current work is centered on building the sophisticated trading engine, utilizing the newly structured integration and wallet management components.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently engaged in the comprehensive implementation of Step 2 of the Meme Trader V4 Pro project, specifically focusing on establishing the core **integration layer** and the **multi-wallet management system**.

The work immediately preceding this summary involved:
1.  **Structuring Integrations**: Creating the  directory to house dedicated modules for various third-party APIs. This involved:
    *   Creating  to define common utilities and HTTP client patterns for all integrations.
    *   Implementing specific client modules for , , , and , abstracting their respective API calls.
    *   Creating  as a placeholder to begin Solana integration.
    *   A critical fix was applied to  to resolve an initial import error, ensuring the integration framework is functional.
2.  **Developing Core Wallet Management**: Establishing the  directory to contain central application logic, particularly for secure wallet handling. This included:
    *   Creating  to manage the creation, loading, and encryption/decryption of multiple execution wallets. This module is vital for adhering to the security requirement of never exposing raw private keys and supporting multi-wallet operations.

The explicit next step declared by the AI engineer was: Now let me create the advanced trading engine with mirror trading and risk management. This indicates that the foundational work on external API integrations and secure multi-wallet handling has been laid out, and the immediate focus is now shifting towards building the complex trading logic that will leverage these newly established components.
